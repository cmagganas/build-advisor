### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI Applications

#### Introduction
- **Objective/Goal**: 
  - Explain the purpose of the AI application and what it aims to achieve.
  - Provide a high-level overview of the release purpose.
  - User Proposal: {user_proposal}

#### Features
- **Feature 1**: 
  - **Description**: Detailed description of the feature.
  - **Goal**: What this feature aims to achieve.
  - **Use Case**: Example of how a user would utilize this feature.
  - **Additional Details**: Specifics such as out-of-scope items and prompt structure.
  
- **Feature 2**: 
  - **Description**: Detailed description of the feature.
  - **Goal**: What this feature aims to achieve.
  - **Use Case**: Example of how a user would utilize this feature.
  - **Additional Details**: Specifics such as out-of-scope items and prompt structure.

*(Repeat for each feature)*

#### UX Flow & Design Notes
- **Overview**: General guidance required to ensure the release objectives are met.
- **User Workflow**: Describe the overall user workflow.
- **Design Considerations**: Any specific design notes relevant at this stage.

#### System & Environment Requirements
- **Supported Environments**: 
  - Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Operating Systems (e.g., Windows 10, macOS)
  - Memory and Processing Power requirements

#### Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies
- **Assumptions**: 
  - List anything expected to be in place (e.g., all users will have Internet connectivity).
  
- **Constraints**: 
  - Dictate limits for the implementation (e.g., budgetary constraints, technical limitations).
  
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Conditions or items the product will rely on (e.g., relying on Google Maps for directions).

#### Prompt Engineering Practices
- **Ambiguity Mitigation**: Ensure clear, specific prompts to avoid ambiguous outputs. Evaluate prompts using examples and test consistency with different inputs.
- **Versioning**: Track and version each prompt to monitor performance changes over time.
- **Optimization**: Apply techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, majority voting, and breaking tasks into smaller prompts to improve output quality.
- **Cost & Latency Management**: Balance detailed prompts with cost efficiency and manage latency by optimizing token usage.

#### Task Composability
- **Multiple Tasks Composition**: Outline how multiple tasks interact, including sequential and parallel executions, and control flows like if statements and loops.
- **Agents and Tools**: Describe the use of agents to manage tasks and the integration of tools such as SQL executors and web browsers.
- **Control Flows**: Detail the use of control flows in managing tasks, including sequential, parallel, if statements, and loops.

#### Review & Approval Process
- **Initial Review**: 
  - Steps for internal product team review.
  - Feedback incorporation.
  
- **Business Side Stakeholders Review**: 
  - Process for aligning with business stakeholders.
  
- **Engineering Handoff**: 
  - Clarifications and updates based on technical team feedback.
  
- **Final Approval**: 
  - Ensuring no surprises later on.
  - Agreement from all teams involved (UX design, engineering, QA).
