      "   - **Reason**: Ensuring the chatbot is built on a reliable technology stack, is secure, and accessible to a broad audience is crucial. This requires substantial upfront investment in both research and development to adhere to best practices and regulatory standards, impacting the project's long-term viability and user trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implementation of Machine Learning for Response Accuracy**\n",
      "   - **Priority**: Medium-High\n",
      "   - **Reason**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve response accuracy is essential for a scalable, user-friendly experience. While initially, the chatbot may function with a pre-defined Q&A set, the ability to learn from interactions and improve over time will require significant investment in machine learning expertise and technology but is critical for long-term success and user satisfaction.\n",

      "   - **Reason**: Although critical for the success of the Portfolio Chatbot, the go-to-market strategy requires moderate investments compared to product development and technical requirements. The strategy focuses on leveraging existing networks and social media, which can be cost-effective and builds on existing platforms but requires careful planning and execution to maximize reach and engagement.\n",
