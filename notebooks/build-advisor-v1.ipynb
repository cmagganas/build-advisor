      "1. **Security and Privacy Enhancements**\n",
      "   - Ensuring user data protection and compliance with global privacy laws like GDPR is crucial for user trust and legal compliance. High priority due to the critical importance of security and privacy in today’s digital environment.\n",

      "2. **Detailed Technical Specifications for NLP**\n",
      "   - Defining technical specifications is essential for the development process, guiding the team in choosing the right tools and ensuring the chatbot’s effectiveness in understanding and processing user queries. High priority for foundational development.\n",
