      "Based on your requirement for a portfolio chatbot, here's a tailored Product Requirements Document (PRD) to guide its development:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Portfolio Chatbot PRD\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "**Objective/Goal**:\n",
      "- Develop a chatbot that interacts with potential employers or recruiters by providing detailed responses about your professional experience, qualifications, and any relevant projects or skills related to the role you're applying for.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Features\n",
      "\n",
      "**Feature 1: Interactive Question-Answering** \n",
      "- **Description**: The chatbot will leverage NLP to understand and respond to queries about your professional background, skills, qualifications, and work experiences.\n",
      "- **Goal**: To simulate a real-time conversation with recruiters, offering them a personalized experience.\n",
      "- **Use Case**: A recruiter inquiring about your experience with Python will receive a detailed answer highlighting your years of experience, projects completed, and the proficiency level.\n",
      "- **Additional Details**: The chatbot will not require personal user data from the recruiter, focusing solely on professional information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Feature 2: Role-Specific Responses** \n",
      "- **Description**: Tailor responses based on specific roles or requirements mentioned by the recruiter.\n",
      "- **Goal**: To emphasize aspects of your portfolio that are most relevant to the position in question.\n",
      "- **Use Case**: If a recruiter mentions looking for a frontend developer, the chatbot immediately highlights your expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relevant projects.\n",
      "- **Additional Details**: The system will include a mapping mechanism to correlate job roles with specific skills and experiences in your portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### UX Flow & Design Notes\n",
      "- **Overview**: The chatbot will be integrated on professional networking sites or personal portfolio pages with an inviting user interface prompting the recruiter to start the dialogue.\n",
      "- **User Workflow**: Users initiate interaction by typing in a question or selecting pre-set queries about your qualifications. The chatbot will then guide the conversation based on the query, asking follow-up questions if necessary.\n",
      "- **Design Considerations**: Ensure the chat interface is accessible, intuitive, and does not require extensive technical knowledge to interact with.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### System & Environment Requirements\n",
      "- **Supported Environments**:\n",
      "  - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.\n",
      "  - Operating Systems: Windows 10, macOS.\n",
      "  - Mobile responsiveness for access on smartphones and tablets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies\n",
      "- **Assumptions**:\n",
      "  - Recruiters have a basic understanding of how to interact with chatbots.\n",
      "- **Constraints**:\n",
      "  - The chatbot will rely on accurately updated information to remain relevant.\n",
      "- **Dependencies**:\n",
      "  - Integration with professional networking platforms for live data updates and LinkedIn APIs for fetching the latest portfolio updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Prompt Engineering Practices\n",
      "- **Ambiguity Mitigation**: Use structured data for the backend portfolio information to streamline clear, specific responses.\n",
      "- **Versioning**: Implement version control for the chatbot's knowledge base to keep it updated with the newest information.\n",
      "- **Optimization**: Regularly test the chatbot interaction flows and update based on feedback to improve conversational accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Task Composability\n",
      "- **Multiple Tasks Composition**: The chatbot will handle multiple inquiries in a single session, prioritizing by the sequence of the conversation.\n",
      "- **Agents and Tools**: Utilize AI conversational agents with integration of filtering tools to select the most relevant portfolio pieces for each question.\n",
      "- **Control Flows**: Implement conditional logic to guide the flow of conversation based on the context and complexity of the inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Review & Approval Process\n",
      "- **Initial Review**: Your own review of the chatbot's responses to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "- **Business Side Stakeholders Review**: Seek feedback from mentors or colleagues in your industry.\n",
      "- **Engineering Handoff**: Detailed documentation for developers on the team, ensuring they understand the requirements and constraints.\n",
      "- **Final Approval**: Test the chatbot with a group of recruiter contacts for real-world feedback and final adjustments.\n",
