      "To create a portfolio chatbot as proposed, let's outline a Product Requirements Document (PRD) tailored to this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Portfolio Chatbot PRD\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "- **Objective/Goal**: Develop an interactive, user-friendly chatbot designed to answer questions regarding an individual's work experience, skills, education, and qualifications relevant to a job role they're applying for. The chatbot aims to provide potential employers or recruiters with insightful, personalized responses, simulating a conversational interview with the candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Features\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Feature 1: Personalized Responses**\n",
      "  - **Description**: The chatbot will generate personalized responses based on the user's query about the candidate‚Äôs experience, skills, and education. It involves processing natural language inputs to provide specific details from the candidate's portfolio.\n",
      "  - **Goal**: To deliver tailored information that represents the candidate effectively, improving engagement with recruiters.\n",
      "  - **Use Case**: A recruiter asks, \"Can you tell me about your experience with project management?\" The chatbot responds with detailed information about relevant experience, highlighting specific roles and achievements.\n",
      "  - **Additional Details**: Responses will be formulated from a structured dataset containing the candidate's portfolio information. Out-of-scope items include answering questions beyond the provided dataset, like speculative scenarios or opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Feature 2: Interactive Resume Navigation**\n",
      "  - **Description**: The chatbot allows users to navigate the candidate's career timeline, education, and project portfolio interactively.\n",
      "  - **Goal**: Enable users to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the candidate's background in a conversational manner.\n",
      "  - **Use Case**: The user queries, \"Show me the projects from 2021\", and the chatbot presents the relevant projects with summaries.\n",
      "  - **Additional Details**: The chatbot will use menu prompts and keywords to guide the user through the portfolio database.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### UX Flow & Design Notes\n",
      "- **Overview**: The chatbot should maintain a conversational tone, providing a seamless, engaging interaction. It must handle unrecognized queries gracefully, guiding users back to the available information.\n",
      "- **User Workflow**: \n",
      "  - Users initiate the chat with a greeting or direct question.\n",
      "  - The chatbot provides a brief introduction and available commands.\n",
      "  - Users input queries, and the chatbot responds with relevant information.\n",
      "  - Users can follow up or ask new questions, navigating different portfolio sections.\n",
      "- **Design Considerations**: Ensure the chat interface is intuitive, with clear options for users unfamiliar with the candidate's portfolio. Include fallback mechanisms for misunderstood inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### System & Environment Requirements\n",
      "- **Supported Environments**:\n",
      "  - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n",
      "  - Operating Systems: Windows 10, macOS, Linux\n",
      "  - Ensures mobile responsiveness for access on smartphones and tablets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies\n",
      "- **Assumptions**: \n",
      "  - Users have basic proficiency in using chat interfaces.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Constraints**: \n",
      "  - The chatbot will be limited by the comprehensiveness of the input data regarding the candidate's portfolio.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Dependencies**: \n",
      "  - Relies on AI Natural Language Processing (NLP) services such as Google's Dialogflow or OpenAI's GPT for interpreting and generating responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Prompt Engineering Practices\n",
      "- **Ambiguity Mitigation**: Refine prompts to include context-specific examples, enhancing the chatbot's accuracy in delivering relevant responses.\n",
      "- **Versioning**: Implement version control for the dataset and scripts, enabling systematic updates and improvements.\n",
      "- **Optimization**: Regularly test and refine the chatbot's responses, ensuring consistency and relevance to the user's queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Task Composability\n",
      "- Incorporate sequential task processing for follow-up questions, allowing users to drill down into details within the same context.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Review & Approval Process\n",
      "- **Initial Review**: Share with a focus group consisting of HR professionals and potential users for initial feedback.\n",
      "- **Engineering Handoff**: Detail specific technical requirements and dependencies identified during the review phase.\n",
      "- **Final Approval**: Ensure all feedback is addressed, securing sign-off from all stakeholders, including the technical team, project sponsor, and a representative user group.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following this PRS, the development and launch of the portfolio chatbot will be well-structured and focused on providing a valuable tool for job applicants and recruiters alike.\n"
